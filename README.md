# Project
Repository for my UBC Toolkit course.
This repository is for practicing data science workflows using GitHub, Conda, and JupyterLab.  
It contains example notebooks, scripts, and an environment file to reproduce the setup.

## Contents
- `environment.yaml` – Conda environment specification for reproducibility  
- `.gitignore` – rules for files that should not be tracked by Git  
- Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for experiments and analysis  

## Setup
1. Create the environment:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yaml
